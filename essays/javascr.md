As a complete newbie to programming in Javascript the adjustment has been somewhat strange, although most aspects are similar to previous languages I have used. In the past I have experienced programming in Java and C for the most part. Perhaps the strangest difference thus far is the use of 'Let' and 'Const' and not having to declare a variables type. For the most part however, the fundamentals of programming stay the same from language to language, with nearly all modern languages. 
From a software engineering perspective, it often seems the most useful languages are the ones which are the most popular. In this, Javascript is obviously a frontrunner. This is not to say that by itself Javascript is not a powerful language; however with such a large base this leads to enviroments such as Node, Angular and others. Having such a large array of frameworks, engines and enviroments that extend the base code, Javascript becomes an extremely versatile language. It is possible to web development(both server side and client side), mobile development and even game development using Javascript. 
So far I have enjoyed the "athletic software engineering" approach. Having practice WODs is a great way to learn, and the timed approach to learning forces you to think on your feet. 

It is interesting to me that software development has seemed to, in many respects, move towards high-level almost modularized languages such as Javascript, Python and Ruby and away from lower level languages. Certainly,the barrier to entry is lower for these "scripting" languages.
