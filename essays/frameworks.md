Anyone who has used raw HTML and CSS in the past knows just how painful it can be. Of course understanding and experiencing these building blocks of the web is extremely important and I believe one should develop a firm grasp on the raw languages before piling on frameworks. That being said, frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI are extremely useful and I believe necessary for a good web developer to have in their arsenal.
After working with Semantic UI for a short time my amateur creations with raw HTML now look like they could be used by real companies. That being said these frameworks do require a certain amount of sweat to be put in before they can be used effectively. Even Semantic UI, which is incredibly intuitive, will take a certain amount of research and reference before it can be put to good use. I very much like how intuitive and obvious the semantic keywords are. Using keywords like 'Massive' to create a very large button almost seems out of place to see in a programming language but feels refreshing. I think the most impressive part of Semantic UI to me has been how responsive it is. The framework is essentially utilizing the power of real scripting languages within a markup language without any 'real' coding. Still there does seem to be an element of 'suprise' in it which feels concerning. It may just be that I haven't learned the in's and outs of the framework yet but it seems to lack the precision that a professional software developer may need. I am excited to see where frameworks like Semantic can bring me, and to experience the other frameworks which could push my design to the next level.
