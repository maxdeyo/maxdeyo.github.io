In exploring the different resources available online to base CSExplore on, it seems like there is a lot of different ways we could take this project. More than just the resources, we also have the whole Radgrad infrastructure to pull from. 
One of my worries in building CSExplore is the limited scope of the userbase. I'm concerned that only those who absolutely want to major in Computer Science in College would use it. Today Computer Science has influence in practically every discipline and knowing basic programming can be useful for almost everyone. I hope that in making CSExplore we can give resources to those not interested in a career strictly in Computer Science to still take part. This could mean an Entreprenuerial minded student connecting with a team of programmers or a non-STEM student learning programming for its day-to-day applications.

The simplest option is to make the app a compilation of all the best CS resources we can find. This would mean connecting students with online coding courses(Code.org, ExploringCS, CodeHS) and helping them with professional development. To keep this from being simply a "wiki page of resources" we would have to implement some sort of reward system. This could be virtual, with nothing but bragging rights or have some impact on the real world, possibly by integration with high schools and colleges. 

An alternative basis for the app or a potential additional feature would be something similar to HackClub. In HackClub students are able to put together their own CS clubs in their area. This could mean building an alternative to HackClub where local students can share their projects and connect with other students. We could provide updates to local events held by either students or organizations, and allow students to build a portfolio. For example HACC2020 could be posted and high school students could mark if they'll attend and find potential team members. Integration with RadGrad could allow high school students to connect with college students and find a mentor.

Another option for the app is taking influence from the coding curriculums listed in resources and building one ourself. It could mean fun games that teach the basic principles of coding to high school students. To take out the tedious aspect of building individual games, we could set up a framework for teachers to build games themselves. This one's a bit outlandish and its probably smarter to utilize the resources available to us more.

One thing I think its important to remember is the research aspect of the project. We should be collecting data where we can and most importantly getting feedback from students! If we have say, two lesson plans recommended for students to follow, that take two different approaches to teaching we could allow students to rank them and it would be a confirmation of the validity of one teaching method.
