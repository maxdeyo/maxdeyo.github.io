summary: I took a four month trip across Europe and Morocco.
---
During the Fall of 2017 I spent four months traveling across Europe and Morocco. Over the course of my trip I had the chance to visit the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Morocco. I started my trip in Amsterdam and spent about 10 days exploring the Netherlands, including visiting The Hague and Dutch Parliament. From there I traveled through Germany, making my way through the formal capital of Germany, Bonn, onto Frankfurt, then Stuttgart. At the time I was visiting, Oktoberfest celebrations were happening across the country, and so I was able to experience Stuttgart's celebration which is the second largest in the world. After experiencing the festival at Stuttgart, I made my way to the heart of Oktoberfest, Munich. After about a month in Germany and plenty of beer, I took a bus to Prague where I explored the gothic architecture of the lengendary city for 10 days. From Prague, I took another bus to possibly my favorite destination of the trip, Budapest. I stayed in Budapest for nearly two months, experiencing Hungarian culture and one of the largest cities in Eastern Europe. There is a lot I love about Budapest; how cheap everything is, the simple, efficient public transportation system and of course the incredible architecture. During my stay in Budapest I moved across AirBNB's in nearly every major section of the city. I got to experience the quieter, more residential side of Buda and the more fast paced nightlife of Pest. Finally, my visa had ran out in Europe, and so to extend the trip a little longer I took a three week job as a receptionist in a hostel in Morocco. For these three weeks I stayed in the blue pearl of Morocco, Chefchauoen.
