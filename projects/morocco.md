summary: I worked as a receptionist at a hostel in Morocco.
---
During December of 2017 I spent three weeks working as a receptionist at a youth hostel in Chefchaouen, Morocco. Chefchaouen is often referred to as the "Blue Pearl" of Morocco, nicknamed such because of its bright blue colors painted on the inner walls of the city. The city is settled in the Northwest mountains of Morocco and is a popular tourist destination for Moroccans and Europeans to visit.
I found the work as a receptionist on the volunteering website, Workaway. As a volunteer receptionist, I was responsible for checking guests in, cleaning around the hostel and helping the guests with any of their needs. In exchange the hostel's owner provided me free room and board. The work was a fantastic experience, because as a receptionist I met nearly every guest that checked in and was able to talk with the guests and learn more about their culture and where they had come from. There was also a very strong "Backpacker Culture" among the guests of the hostel which gave everyone the opportunity to share stories of their travels. The experience was extremely fun and pushed me to travel more and experience new cultures.
